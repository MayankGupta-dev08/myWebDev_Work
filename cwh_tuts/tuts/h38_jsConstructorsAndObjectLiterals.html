        <h1>Object Literals, Constructors and Object Oriented JavaScript</h1>
        <p>Before getting into the detail of JavaScript OOP concepts, let us first understand what Object-oriented
            programming (OOP) is. The basic idea of object-oriented programming is that objects are used to model real
            world things that we want to represent inside our programs. We can also describe OOP as the OOP provides a
            simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.</p>
    </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are objects?</h2>
            <p>Objects can contain related code and data, representing information about the thing we are trying to
                model, and functionality that we want it to have. Object data is stored neatly inside an object package,
                making
                it easy to structure and access. <br>
                JavaScript is a powerful programming language that supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In
                JavaScript, objects created using object literal are singletons. This means when we made a change in an
                object, it affects the object entire the script. Whereas if an object is created using the constructor
                function, then the change will not affect the object throughout the script.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Objects created using object literal:-</h3>
            <p>Since these are singletons, a change to an object affects the object's entire script. A change in one
                instance will affect all the instances of the object. Object literal is a comma-separated list of
                name-value pairs inside the curly braces. The object literals encapsulate the data. This minimizes the
                use of global variables, which
                can cause problems when combining the code.</p>
            <p>However, if we have to create multiple instances of a structure and perform operations based on
                predefined values, then we should use a function constructor.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Objects created using the constructor function:-</h3>
            <p>The object that is defined with a function constructor lets us have multiple instances of that object. If
                the change is made to one instance, it will not affect other instances. As we know that the constructor
                is essentially a function that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. A convention for declaring
                constructors is always to capitalize its function name.</p>
            <h4>"new" keyword:-</h4>
            <p>
                To create a new object instance, we use the "new" keyword to create an object based on a constructor.
                Adding the "new" keyword is a crucial step when creating an object from a constructor. The new keyword
                creates a new empty object. It binds property or function, which is declared with this keyword to the
                new object.</p>
